An End-to-End Automatic Methodology to Accelerate the Accuracy Evaluation of DNN under Hardware Transient Faults
================================================================================================================
Introduction
------------
This project is designed to quickly estimate the impact of bitflips on deep neural networks (DNNs) without fault injection. <br>
To validate the effectiveness of our approach, A-Mean, we compare the estimated results from A-Mean with ground truth data obtained through fault injection. <br>
The datasets used in this evaluation include ImageNet (2012 validation set), CIFAR100, CIFAR10, and STL10. (The ImageNet and STL10 need to be downloaded in advance) <br>
